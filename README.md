# DataManagement2017

Introduction ：

In project 1, you will implement a very simple paged file (PF) manager. 
It builds up the basic file system required for continuing with projects 2,3 and 4. 
The PF component provides classes and methods for managing files and pages in files. 
In addition, you will implement the first few operations for a record-based file (RBF) 
manager (which you will continue working on in part 2 of the project) on top of your 
basic paged file system. This document aims at providing you with the necessary 
information required to start project 1.

Goal ：

The goal of project 1 is threefold:

Get (re)familiar with a C/C++ development environment.
Implement a simple paged file system.
Implement a few operations of a record-oriented (a.k.a. tuple-oriented) file system.
